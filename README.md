This repo contains data and code related to the $N$-components cat teleamplifier ($N$-CT) device. Using the code given in [cat-teleamplifier.ipynb](https://github.com/JGuanzon/cat-teleamplifier/blob/main/cat-teleamplifier.ipynb), we created the numerical results and graphs given in our most recent paper in Ref. [[1](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.108.032411)]. Since these simulations can take a while, we also saved important simulated data as csv files in the [data folder](https://github.com/JGuanzon/cat-teleamplifier/tree/main/data).
